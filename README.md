# WeatherApp
- Create a login for the user, who will then have their data saved in a database. 
Additionally, the user would be able to record their location and, more specifically, the cities they prefer to visit more frequently than others. 
The program would show the current weather in addition to the forecast for the next five days. Along with the temperature, it would also contain the humidity, wind, and how it feels right now. 
The user could look for different cities and places where they wanted to know the temperature, and it would provide the time since the latest update.
The user would also be able to see the daily minimum and maximum temperatures as well as the time of sunrise and sunset, along with the humidity throughout the day. 
A weather detector that can inform the user of the presence of thunderstorms, drizzle, snowfall, rain, or sun would be another feature we'd want to include.
